# Collaborative-R_ISL
This repository is for those working through the text "Introduction to Statistical Learning in R"

Welcome!  I hope if you are reading this you want to join a group committed to improving their R skills while getting an overview of current statistical techniques.  Most, if not all, of us are busy people who are squeezing this learning into rare moments of (slightly) freer time. In this environment it helps to have fellow learners to share your triumphs and troubles with and give you a little more incentive to get it done. That is the purpose of this group

The statistical language R (https://www.r-project.org) , my preferred platform for using R called R studio (https://www.rstudio.com/) and the online copy of the textbook and supporting materials (https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) are all free.

I envisage two clusters of people participating in the collaboration.  One would be a cluster of beginners who have managed to install R (and maybe R studio) and are working through the beginning steps of loading some data and starting to manipulate and look at it. Cluster one would have collaborators to help when they get stuck and more detailed analyses examples to wet their appetite for more. The second cluster would be those at an intermediate level who want to explore some to the statistical concepts from the text and have their peers discuss options in the analysis and use of R.  Given the topic you might migrate between clusters one and two

So we will start by working together on one to two questions from the textbook each month. There will be some guidelines given for cluster one.  [Click here](https://github.com/br-mcdermott/Collaborative-R_ISL/blob/master/Oct-Nov%202018%20Assignment) to find the current questions set.

I hope you will join us either at this Github repository or at the "Go to Meeting" site .....
